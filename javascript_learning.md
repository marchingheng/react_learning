# JS Learning
ECMAScript: standard for javascript followed by all developers and browsers
DOM: document object model, manipulate nodes in web page in ood way with Javascript. There are 4 types of nodes in the model: html, tag, attribute, text
DOM event: mouseclick, mousemove...
BOM: interact with browser by javascript: browser will store the history of visited routes in a stack, so you can go back and forth in the history of routes. And every route will match a specific rendering of components
front end code will be obfuscated then downloaded to the browser, so the front end logic won't be exposed to the user. But still before and after obfuscation, they are JavaScript code.
Backend code vs frontend code: not downloaded to browser vs downloaded to browser; run in server vs run by browser; complex business logic vs simple business logic/logic related to UI.
